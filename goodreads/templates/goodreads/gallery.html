    This graph shows some summary statistics about your library. Your library can be tabulated into fiction and
    non-fiction and authors by gender.
    Other graphs show the distribution of when the books were written, what the longest ones are, and the most
    common genres you've read.

    This shows the books that are the least commonly finished in your library.
    The percentage represents how many people marked a book as "to read" out of the total number that marked it as "finished". <br>
    Popular books that have been published for a while like the Harry Potter series have a read rate of ~95%. <br>
    The plot is divided into books that you have finished and those that you have not (if your export includes books you have marked as "to-read").

        Goodreads allows users to define their own shelves, and these shelves are then tabulated to create a crowdsourced set of genres per book. <br>
        This following plot shows the genres in which I have read more than an average user, and then genres in which I have read less. <br>

    This shows the number of Goodreads users who have read this book, i.e. its popularity. It is divided into logarithmic tiers. <br>
        Most people read primarily popular books, and the 100,000-1,000,000 band is generally the most crowded. <br> The Harry Potter and Hunger Game books are the alltime most popular, with about ~8 mil readers.
        It may surprise you how few other people have read some of your books.<br>
        Pink represents Fiction, blue Non-fiction.
