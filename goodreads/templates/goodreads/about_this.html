	I began this project initially to analyze my own book reading history. After years where I absorbed information largely through podcasts, websites and conversations, reading was becoming more and more important to me. I don't read particularly fast, and each finished book felt like an achievement. I started by creating a spreadsheet to track the books I'd read and slowly filled it in and added more fields I found interesting, such as number of pages and the nationality of the author.

	Later I discovered the book cataloguing website Goodreads. I realized here was a data repository that would have the data fields I wanted, as well as interesting new crowd-sourced insights made possible only by mass adoption. This includes the "shelf names", user-defined genres, as well as readership numbers. Goodreads allows users to export their books data, but it does not include a lot of these more insightful fields. I started building a pipeline to scrape those additional fields, and later added functions to look up the gender and nationality of the author. The pipeline generates plots of the reading data including a map of world authors and a plot facetted by popularity (the number of other users who have added this book to their account). I have been able to refine the graphs and the code with the help of a number of friends who have exported me their Goodreads data.
