	I initially built out data visualizations using Goodreads data, but in this section I have expanded to music, utilizing Spotify streaming histories and the APIs Spotify makes available for retrieving song metainformation. Spotify provides some personalized data-driven insights to users every year in their Spotify Wrapped, and those are widely popular despite being very simplistic summaries. This website allows for a deeper look in your listening habits and how they have evolved. I have personally found it interesting exploring my time of use patterns, as well as seeeing what songs or artists I had listened to at previous times, and what genres I listen or don't listen to. The Spotify data is interesting because songs are short, one can explore new genres quite quickly. However Spotify does not provide significant streaming history through their API, and only returns data requests after several days.

	This site is not about recommendations. Everyone else on the internet is already using your data to serve your "recommendations", so that you buy what they want you to buy. This site is about you profiting off of your data instead.
